## About Tangerines

Tangerines are small orange fruits that belong to the citrus family. Tangerines are soft and tender on the inside while a relatively hard layer of skin encompasses the fruit. They are also well known for their refreshing and invigorating taste. The tangeriene's flavor strikes a nice balance between sour and sweet as its natural abundance of sugar is counteracted by its acidity. In addition, tangerines are still excellent sources of Vitamin C and have numerous health benefits. Though they may often be overshadows by their cousins, oranges, tangerines are amazing fruits that are both healthy and tasty.

## History
Said to be indigenous to the tropical and subtropical climates of the Southeastern regions of Asia, the tangerine spread accross the globe as a result of trade routes such as the Silk Road. The rapid growth of civilization and the growing interconnectedness between different peoples only supported the spread of tangerines. However, it was not until the first tangerines were exported from Tangier, Morocco to Europe that the tangerine received its name. The tangerine is now planted across the world in regions of Africa, Asia, Australia, North America, South America, and more!
